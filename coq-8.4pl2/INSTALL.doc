                           The Coq documentation
                           =====================

The Coq documentation includes 

- A Reference Manual
- A Tutorial
- A document presenting the Coq standard library
- A list of questions/answers in the FAQ style

The sources of the documents are mainly made of LaTeX code from which
user-readable PostScript or PDF files, or a user-browsable bunch of
html files are generated.

Prerequisite
------------

To produce the PostScript documents, the following tools
are needed:

  - latex (latex2e)
  - dvips
  - bibtex
  - makeindex
  - pngtopnm and pnmtops (for the Reference Manual and the FAQ)

To produce the PDF documents, the following tools are needed:

  - pdflatex
  - bibtex

To produce the html documents, the following tools are needed:

  - hevea (e.g. 1.07 works)


Under Debian based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, ...) a
working set of packages for compiling the documentation for Coq is:

  texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-math-extra texlive-fonts-extra
  texlive-lang-french texlive-humanities texlive-pictures latex-xcolor
  hevea netpbm

        to produce all formats of the tutorial

   make rectutorial
        to produce all formats of the tutorial on recursive types

   make faq
        to produce all formats of the FAQ

   make stdlib
   	to produce all formats of the Coq standard library
