.SH DESCRIPTION

.B coqchk
is the standalone checker of compiled libraries (.vo files produced by
coqc) for the Coq Proof Assistant. See the Reference Manual for more

succeeded. A non-zero return code means that something went wrong: some
library was not found, corrupted content, type-checking failure, etc.

short or qualified name.
