(* Module defining the last essential tiles of interactive proofs.
   The features of the Proof module are undoing and focusing.
   A proof is a mutable object, it contains a proofview, and some information
   to be able to undo actions, and to unfocus the current view. All three
   of these being meant to evolve.
   - Proofview: a proof is primarily the data of the current view.
     That which is shown to the user (as a remainder, a proofview
     is mainly the logical state of the proof, together with the
     currently focused goals).
   - Focus: a proof has a focus stack: the top of the stack contains
     the context in which to unfocus the current view to a view focused
     with the rest of the stack.
     In addition, this contains, for each of the focus context,  a 
     "focus kind" and a "focus condition" (in practice, and for modularity,
     the focus kind is actually stored inside the condition). To unfocus, one
     needs to know the focus kind, and the condition (for instance "no condition" or
     the proof under focused must be complete) must be met.
   - Undo: since proofviews and focus stacks are immutable objects, 
     it could suffice to hold the previous states, to allow to return to the past.
     However, we also allow other modules to do actions that can be undone.
     Therefore the undo stack stores action to be ran to undo.
