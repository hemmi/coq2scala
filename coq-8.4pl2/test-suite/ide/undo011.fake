INTERP Variable A : Prop.
INTERP Variable B : Prop.
INTERP Axiom OR : A \/ B.
INTERP Lemma MyLemma2 : True.
INTERP proof.
INTERP per cases of (A \/ B) by OR.
INTERP suppose A.
INTERP     then (1 = 1).
INTERP     then H1 : thesis.
INTERP     thus thesis by H1.
INTERP suppose B.
REWIND 1
# <replay>
INTERP suppose B.
# </replay>
REWIND 2
# <replay>
INTERP     thus thesis by H1.
INTERP suppose B.
# </replay>
INTERP    then (1 = 1).
INTERP    then H2 : thesis.
INTERP    thus thesis by H2.
INTERP end cases.
INTERP end proof.
